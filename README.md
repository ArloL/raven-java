# Raven

Raven is a Java client for [Sentry](https://www.getsentry.com/).
Besides the regular client you can use within your application code, this
project also provides tools allowing the most popular logging frameworks
to send the logs directly to sentry:

 - `java.util.logging` is supported out of the box.
 - `raven-log4j` adds the support for
 [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/).
 - `raven-log4j2` adds the support for
 [log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/).
 - `raven-logback` adds the support for [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/).

Raven supports both HTTP(S) and UDP transport of events.

## Sentry Protocol and supported versions
### Sentry Protocol versions
Since the version 3.0, Raven the versionning system is based on the
protocol version of Sentry. This means that Raven-3.x only supports
the version 3 of Sentry's protocol while Raven-4.x only supports
the version 4.

Sentry only supports the last two major releases of the protocol, for this
reason, only the last two major versions of Raven are maintained.

### Sentry versions

 - Sentry protocol v4 is not yet available (use Raven-4.x)
 - Sentry protocol v3 is available since Sentry 5.1 (use Raven-3.x)
 - Sentry protocol v2 is available since Sentry 2.0 (use Raven-2.x)

## Build and Installation
**See
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/kencochrane/raven-java/blob/master/INSTALL.md)**

## Options
It is possible to enable some options by adding data to the query string of the
DSN:

    http://public:private@host:port/1?option1=value1&option2&option3=value3

Not every option requires a value.

### Async connection
In order to avoid performance issues due to a large amout of logs being
generated or a slow connection to the Sentry server, it is recommended to use
the asynchronous connection which will use a low priority thread pool to submit
events to Sentry.

To enable the async mode, add the `raven.async` option to your DSN:

    http://public:private@host:port/1?raven.async

#### Threads count (advanced)
By default the thread pool used by the async connection contains one thread per
processor available to the JVM (more threads wouldn't be useful).

It's possible to manually set the number of threads (for example if you want
only one Thread) with the option `raven.async.threads`:

    http://public:private@host:port/1?raven.async&raven.async.threads=1

#### Threads priority (advanced)
As in most cases sending logs to Sentry isn't as important as an application
running smoothly, the threads have a
[minimal priority](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#MIN_PRIORITY).

It is possible to customise this value to increase the priority of those threads
with the option `raven.async.priority`:

    http://public:private@host:port/1?raven.async.priority=10&raven.async

### Inapp classes
**TODO**

### Compression
By default the content sent to Sentry is compressed and encoded in base64 before
being sent.
This operation allows to send a smaller amount of data for each event.
However compressing and encoding the data adds a CPU and memory overhead which
might not be useful if the connection to Sentry is fast and reliable.

Depending on the limitations of the project (ie: a mobile application with a
limited connection, Sentry hosted on an external network), it can be interesting
to compress the data beforehand or not.

It's possible to disable the compression with the option `raven.nocompression`

    http://public:private@host:port/1?raven.nocompression

### Timeout (advanced)
To avoid blocking the thread because of a connection taking too much time, a
timeout can be set by the connection.

By default the connection will set up its own timeout, but it's possible to
manually set one with `raven.timeout` (in milliseconds):

    http://public:private@host:port/1?raven.timeout=10000
